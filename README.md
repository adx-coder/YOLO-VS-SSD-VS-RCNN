# Object Detection with YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN, and SSD

This project demonstrates how to apply three different object detection models (YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN, and SSD) to images, perform inference, and compare the results. The object detection is done on the 'indoor-object-detection' dataset from Kaggle.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository (if applicable) or copy the code into your working environment.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python kagglehub ultralytics torch torchvision tqdm matplotlib pandas google-colab
```

### 3. Download Dataset

The dataset will be automatically downloaded from Kaggle using the `kagglehub` package. Ensure you have configured Kaggle authentication by setting up your API key before running the code.

### 4. Running the Code

The main steps involved in this project include:

- Downloading the 'indoor-object-detection' dataset from Kaggle.
- Preprocessing the images (resizing and normalizing).
- Running object detection on each image using:
  - YOLOv8
  - Faster R-CNN
  - SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)
- Saving the processed images with bounding boxes drawn around detected objects.
- Generating and saving comparative analysis results in CSV format.
- Displaying and saving comparison plots for visualizing the detections.

### 5. Example Usage

1. Run the Python script using the following command:

```bash
python object_detection.py
```

2. The script will download the dataset, preprocess the images, and apply the three object detection models.

3. The results, including processed images and detection statistics, will be saved in the `object_detection_results` folder.

4. The processed images and CSV files can be downloaded from the Colab environment (or your local machine, if applicable).

### 6. Checkpoints and Resume Functionality

The script supports checkpointing, allowing you to pause and resume object detection. Each time a batch of images is processed, a checkpoint is saved in the `object_detection_results` folder. If the script is interrupted, it can pick up where it left off.

### 7. Displaying Results

The script saves comparison plots and CSV files for each batch of processed images. These files contain the following information:

- YOLOv8 detections, time taken, and bounding boxes.
- Faster R-CNN detections, time taken, and bounding boxes.
- SSD detections, time taken, and bounding boxes.

### 8. Final Output

After running the object detection on all images, a final CSV file `comparative_analysis_final.csv` will be saved in the results folder, containing detailed detection statistics.

### 9. Zipping and Downloading Results

At the end of the script, the entire results folder will be zipped and downloaded for further inspection or sharing.

## Important Notes

- The script is designed to work in environments like Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks. Ensure you have access to a GPU for faster inference.
- The `google.colab.files` module is included for downloading files within Colab.
